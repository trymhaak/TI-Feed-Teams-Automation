            A vulnerability has been discovered FortiWeb, which could allow for SQL injection. FortiWeb is a web application firewall (WAF) developed by Fortinet. It's designed to protect web applications and APIs from a wide range of attacks, including those targeting known vulnerabilities and zero-day exploits. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for SQL injection attacks that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the system.

            Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

            Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Citrix products, the most severe of which could allow disclosure of sensitive data. Citrix ADC performs application-specific traffic analysis to intelligently distribute, optimize, and secure Layer 4 - Layer 7 network traffic for web applications. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for memory overread, leading to disclosure of potentially sensitive information such as authenticated session tokens. Depending on the sensitive information retrieved via this technique, the attacker may gain further access to the appliance or systems.

            Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC that could allow for remote code execution. Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is a security policy management platform that provides secure access to network resources. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to obtain root privileges on an affected device.
